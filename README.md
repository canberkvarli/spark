# Spark: The Synthesizer Keyboard


[Spark](http://www.canberkvarli.com/spark/) is an interactive demo project which is intented to improve the frontend skills of the oneself as well as creating a musical spark within every soul in the world. Anyone who is curious, interested, or even just to play around with it can find something bigger in themselves that I hope Spark will illuminate their emotions and ideas into music. 


## Functionality & MVP


#### In Spark, users will be able to:

• Play notes using the keyboard. (e.g. Press A to play #C note)

• Adjust the type of the sounds. (e.g. square, sine, sawtooth, etc.)

• Implement an Envelope.

#### In addition, this project will include:

• Instructions on how to enlight your musical mind.  
 
• README.md


### Future Implementations

• Wavelength Display: (COMPLETED ON 09/14/21)
  – Unwind the eyes as the wavelength display will dance while playing with sounds.
  
• Record and Play buttons
